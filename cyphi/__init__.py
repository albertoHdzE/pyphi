CyPhi
=====

CyPhi is a Python library for computing integrated information.


Usage
~~~~~

The :class:`Network` object is the main object on which computations are performed. It represents the network of interest.

The :class:`Subsystem` object is the secondary object; it represents a
subsystem of a network. |big_phi| is defined on subsystems.

The :mod:`cyphi.compute` module is the main entry-point for the library. It
contains methods for calculating concepts, constellations, complexes, etc. See
its documentation for details.


Options
~~~~~~~

There are several module-level options that control aspects of the computation.
They are listed here with their defaults:

- Control whether subsystem cuts should be evaluated in parallel.

    >>> import cyphi
    >>> cyphi.options.PARALLEL_CUT_EVALUATION
    True

- Verbosity level for parallel computation (0 - 100).

    >>> import cyphi
    >>> cyphi.options.VERBOSE_PARALLEL
    20

- Define the Phi value of subsystems containing only a single node with a
  self-loop to be 0.5. If set to False, their Phi will be actually be computed
  (to be zero, in this implementation).

    >>> import cyphi
    >>> cyphi.options.SINGLE_NODES_WITH_SELFLOOPS_HAVE_PHI
    False
