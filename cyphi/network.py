class Network:

    """A network of nodes.

    Represents the network we're analyzing and holds auxilary data about it.

    Examples:
        In a 3-node network, ``a_network.tpm[(0, 0, 1)]`` gives the transition
        probabilities for each node at |t_0| given that state at |t_{-1}| was
        |0,0,1|.

    Attributes:
        size (int):
            The number of nodes in the network.
        tpm (np.ndarray):
            The transition probability matrix for this network. Must be
            provided in state-by-node form. It can be either 2-dimensional, so
            that ``tpm[i]`` gives the probabilities of each node being on if
            the past state is given by the binary representation of ``i``, or
            in N-D form, so that ``tpm[0][1][0]`` gives the probabilities of
            each node being on if the past state is |0,1,0|. The shape of the
            2-dimensional form of the TPM must be ``(S, N)``, and the shape of
            the N-D form of the TPM must be ``[2] * N + [N]``, where ``S`` is
            the number of states and ``N`` is the number of nodes in the
            network.
        current_state (tuple):
            The current state of the network. ``current_state[i]`` gives the
            current state of node ``i``.
        past_state (tuple):
            The past state of the network. ``past_state[i]`` gives the past
            state of node ``i``.
        connectivity_matrix (np.ndarray):
            A matrix describing the network's connectivity.
            ``connectivity_matrix[i][j] == 1`` means that node
            ``i`` is connected to node ``j``.
        nodes (tuple(Node)):
            A tuple of nodes in the network.
        all_nodes (list(Node)):
            Alias for ``nodes``.
