Connectivity Matrices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Throughout PyPhi, if ``CM`` is a connectivity matrix, then |CM[i][j] = 1| means
that node |i| is connected to node |j|.


TPMs
~~~~

There are several ways to write down a TPM. With both state-by-state and
state-by-node TPMs, one is confronted with a choice about which rows correspond
to which states. In state-by-state TPMs, this choice must also be made for the
columns.

Either the first node changes state every other row:

    +------+-----+-----+
    | A, B |  A  |  B  |
    +======+=====+=====+
    | 0, 0 | 0.1 | 0.2 |
    +------+-----+-----+
    | 1, 0 | 0.3 | 0.4 |
    +------+-----+-----+
    | 0, 1 | 0.5 | 0.6 |
    +------+-----+-----+
    | 1, 1 | 0.7 | 0.8 |
    +------+-----+-----+

Or the last node does:

    +------+-----+-----+
    | A, B |  A  |  B  |
    +======+=====+=====+
    | 0, 0 | 0.1 | 0.2 |
    +------+-----+-----+
    | 0, 1 | 0.5 | 0.6 |
    +------+-----+-----+
    | 1, 0 | 0.3 | 0.4 |
    +------+-----+-----+
    | 1, 1 | 0.7 | 0.8 |
    +------+-----+-----+

Note that the index |i| of a row in a TPM encodes a network state: convert the
index to binary, and each bit gives the state of a node. The question is, which
node?

**Throughout PyPhi, we always choose the first conventionâ€”the first node's
state varies the fastest.**

Since numbers are written with the least-significant digit on the right, the
right-most digit varies the fastest. This means that according to our
convention, **the right-most (least-significant) bit gives the state of the
first node**.

We call this convention the **LOLI convention**: Low Order bits correspond to
Low Index nodes. The other convention, where the highest-index node varies the
fastest, is similarly called **HOLI**.

.. note::

    The rationale for this choice of convention is that the **LOLI** mapping is
    stable under changes in the number of nodes, in the sense that the same bit
    always corresponds to the same node index. The **HOLI** mapping does not
    have this property.

.. note::

    This obviously applies to only situations where decimal indices are
    encoding states. Whenever a network state is represented as a list or
    tuple, we use the only sensible convention: the |ith| element gives the
    state of the |ith| node.

.. note::

    There are various conversion functions available for converting between
    TPMs, states, and indices using different conventions: see the
    :mod:`pyphi.convert` module.
